# Fixes Applied - Created By Feature

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Plans Missing Created By Column
**Problem:** Plans page didn't show Created By column
**Solution:** Added Created By column to plans list view

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx`
  - Added `created_by` and `creator` to interface
  - Updated query to join with profiles table
  - Added Created By column to grid (col-span-2)
  - Shows creator avatar + name

### 2. ✅ Create Functions Not Setting created_by
**Problem:** When creating new exercises, workouts, routines, or plans, the `created_by` field was NULL
**Solution:** Updated all create functions to get current user and set `created_by`

**Files Modified:**

1. **Exercises** - `components/dashboard/exercises/create-exercise-dialog.tsx`
   ```typescript
   // Before
   await supabase.from('exercises').insert(exerciseData);

   // After
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   await supabase.from('exercises').insert({
     ...exerciseData,
     created_by: user?.id || null
   });
   ```

2. **Workouts** - `app/dashboard/workouts/page.tsx`
   ```typescript
   // Before
   await supabase.from('workouts').insert({
     name: 'New Workout',
     ...
   });

   // After
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   await supabase.from('workouts').insert({
     name: 'New Workout',
     created_by: user?.id || null,
     ...
   });
   ```

3. **Routines** - `app/dashboard/routines/page.tsx`
   ```typescript
   // Before
   await supabase.from('routines').insert({
     name: 'New Routine',
     ...
   });

   // After
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   await supabase.from('routines').insert({
     name: 'New Routine',
     created_by: user?.id || null,
     ...
   });
   ```

4. **Plans** - `app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx`
   ```typescript
   // Already had user fetching, just added created_by
   await supabase.from('training_plans').insert({
     name: newPlanName.trim(),
     organization_id: staffData.org_id,
     created_by: user.id,  // ← Added this
     ...
   });
   ```

      {item.creator.first_name?.[0]}{item.creator.last_name?.[0]}
    </div>

)}

      email
    )
  `)
```

### Insert Pattern

const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
await supabase.from('table_name').insert({
  ...otherData,
  created_by: user?.id || null
});
