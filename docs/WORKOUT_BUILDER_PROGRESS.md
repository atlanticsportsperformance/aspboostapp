- Each set can have:
  - Custom reps
  - Intensity type dropdown (None, % 1RM, RPE, Load)
  - Intensity value
  - Time
  - Rest
  - Notes
- "Copy ↓" button to copy one set's config to all sets
- Visual summary shows: `8 reps @ 60% | Rest: 90s`

**How it works**:
1. Add an exercise
2. Click "Enable Per-Set" button
3. Configure Set 1: 8 reps @ 60% 1RM
4. Configure Set 2: 10 reps @ 40% 1RM

## ✅ LATEST UPDATES (Tasks 5-8)

### 5. Expand/Collapse Exercise Details ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE

**What was added**:
- ▼/▶ toggle button next to exercise name

- Starts expanded by default
- Helps clean up UI when many exercises present

**Files modified**:
- `components/dashboard/workouts/simple-exercise-card.tsx` - Added isExpanded state and toggle

---

### 6. Single Exercise Blocks ✅

**What was added**:
- Can now create blocks with just 1 exercise
- Button changed from "Link into Superset" to "Create Block"
- Single exercises get named "Block" instead of "Superset"
- Allows better organization of individual exercises with their own notes

**How it works**:
1. Select a single exercise via checkbox
2. Click "Create Block"
3. Exercise moves into its own block with header and notes section

**Files modified**:
- `app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx` - Changed min selection from 2 to 1, updated naming logic

---

### 7. Dropdown Styling Fix ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE

**What was fixed**:
- Dropdown options had white text on white background (unreadable)
- Added proper styling: dark text on white background for options
- Used Tailwind's arbitrary variant syntax: `[&>option]:text-gray-900 [&>option]:bg-white`

**Files modified**:
- `components/dashboard/workouts/set-by-set-editor.tsx` - Fixed intensity type dropdown styling

---

### 8. Metric Schema Integration ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE

**What was added**:
- Exercise cards now pull `metric_schema` from exercises table
- Only show measurement fields that are enabled in the exercise
- Backward compatible: if no metric_schema, show all fields
- Dynamic field rendering based on exercise configuration

**How it works**:
1. Exercise has metric_schema defining enabled measurements (reps, weight, time, distance)
2. Component checks which measurements are enabled
3. Only renders input fields for enabled measurements
4. Always shows: Sets, Rest, RPE (core training fields)
5. Conditionally shows: Reps (min/max), % 1RM, Time

**Example**:
- Exercise with only "reps" + "weight" enabled → shows Sets, Reps (min/max), % 1RM, Rest, RPE
- Exercise with only "time" enabled → shows Sets, Time, Rest, RPE
- Exercise with no metric_schema → shows all fields (backward compatible)

**Files modified**:
- `components/dashboard/workouts/simple-exercise-card.tsx` - Added metric_schema interface, helper functions, conditional rendering
- `app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx` - Added Measurement and metric_schema to Exercise interface

🎯 **Current Focus**: Multi-select exercises in add dialog (next)
