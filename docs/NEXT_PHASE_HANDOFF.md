# üöÄ Ready for Next Phase - Quick Start Guide

## ‚úÖ Exercise Library Phase COMPLETE

### What Just Got Built:
- **Exercise Library** with full CRUD operations
- **Category System**: Strength + Conditioning, Hitting, Throwing (single selection)
- **Tag System**: Flexible multi-tag support (unlimited tags per exercise)
- **Library Manager**: Central hub for managing measurements and tags
- **Filtering**: Category dropdown + multi-tag filter + search
- **Custom Measurements**: Create, edit, delete measurements (some locked)

### Files Ready to Go:
- **Summary**: [EXERCISE_LIBRARY_SUMMARY.md](EXERCISE_LIBRARY_SUMMARY.md)
- **Database Schema**: [components/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](components/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SQL Migration Required (Run First!)

**In Supabase SQL Editor, run**:

```sql
-- Add category column back alongside tags
ALTER TABLE exercises ADD COLUMN category text DEFAULT 'strength_conditioning';

-- Update category based on existing tags (best guess migration)
UPDATE exercises SET category = 'hitting' WHERE 'hitting' = ANY(tags);
UPDATE exercises SET category = 'throwing' WHERE 'throwing' = ANY(tags) OR 'pitching' = ANY(tags);

-- Make category required (not null)
ALTER TABLE exercises ALTER COLUMN category SET NOT NULL;

-- Verify migration
SELECT id, name, category, tags FROM exercises WHERE is_active = true LIMIT 10;
```

## üìã Exercise Schema (Final)

```typescript
exercises {
  id: uuid
  name: text                    // "Back Squat"
  category: text (NOT NULL)     // 'strength_conditioning' | 'hitting' | 'throwing'
  tags: text[]                  // ['power', 'lower_body', 'mobility']
  description: text
  video_url: text
  cues: text[]
  equipment: text[]
  metric_schema: jsonb {        // Custom measurements
    measurements: [
      { id: 'reps', name: 'Reps', type: 'integer', unit: 'reps', enabled: true }
    ]
  }
  is_active: boolean
  created_at: timestamptz
  updated_at: timestamptz
}
```

## üéØ Suggested Next Phase: Plans/Programs

### Option A: Build Plans System
**What**: Create workout plans using exercises
**Tables Needed**:
- `plans` (already exists in schema)
- `workouts` (link to exercises)
- `plan_assignments` (assign to athletes)

**Features**:
1. Plan Builder (drag-drop exercises, set reps/sets/weight)
2. Plan Templates (reusable plans)
3. Assign plans to athletes
4. Schedule workouts on calendar
5. Track progress (record actual reps/weight/time)

### Option B: Athlete Profiles & Progress
**What**: Track athlete data and measurement history
**Features**:
1. Athlete dashboard (profile, stats, history)
2. Record workout results (measurement values)
3. Progress charts (weight lifted over time, velocity trends)
4. Personal records (PRs)
5. Baseline assessments

### Option C: Calendar & Scheduling
**What**: Visual calendar for workout scheduling
**Features**:
1. Monthly/weekly calendar view
2. Drag-drop workouts onto dates
3. Team-wide schedule
4. Athlete-specific schedule
5. Mark completed/skipped

## üí° User's Vision (from context)

Based on previous sessions, the user wants:
- **Athletes** to see their assigned workouts
- **Coaches** to create plans and assign to athletes
- **Track measurements** over time (velocity, power, strength)
- **Baseball-specific** focus (hitting velocity, throwing velocity)
- **Progress visualization** (charts/graphs)

---

## üî• Recommended Next Steps

1. **Run SQL migration** (add category column)
2. **Test Exercise Library** (create/edit/filter exercises)
3. **Choose next phase**: Plans, Athlete Profiles, or Calendar
4. **Define requirements** for next phase with user
5. **Build incrementally** (one feature at a time)

---

## üìä Current Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **UI**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Running**: `http://localhost:3001`

---

## üé® Design System (Established)

- **Primary Color**: `#C9A857` (Gold)
- **Background**: `#0A0A0A` (Near Black)
- **Borders**: `white/10` (10% white opacity)
- **Text**: White primary, Gray-400 secondary
- **Buttons**: Gold primary, White/10 secondary
- **Badges**: Colored with 20% opacity backgrounds

---

## üö´ Known Issues / Tech Debt

- Exercise Creator fetches data on mount (doesn't auto-refresh when Library Manager changes - requires dialog reopen)
- No real-time sync between open dialogs
- Old SQL files can be deleted: `seed-measurements.sql`, `migrate-category-to-tags.sql`

---

## üìù Files You'll Work With Next

If building Plans:
- Create `app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx`
- Create `components/dashboard/plans/plan-builder.tsx`
- Add Plans navigation link to `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

If building Athlete Profiles:
- Enhance `app/dashboard/athletes/page.tsx`
- Create `app/dashboard/athletes/[id]/page.tsx` (individual profile)
- Add progress tracking components

If building Calendar:
- Create `app/dashboard/calendar/page.tsx`
- Integrate with `workout_instances` table
- Add drag-drop scheduling
