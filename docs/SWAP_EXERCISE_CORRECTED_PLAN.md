# Swap/Replace Exercise Feature - CORRECTED Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ CORRECT Understanding

When swapping/replacing an exercise, **ALL programming details stay exactly the same**. We ONLY change which exercise it is.

### Example (Correct):
```
BEFORE SWAP:
  Placeholder "Lower Body Power"
  - 3 sets x 8 reps @ 75% 1RM
  - 90s rest
  - Note: "Focus on explosiveness"

AFTER SWAP (replace with Power Clean):
  Power Clean
  - 3 sets x 8 reps @ 75% 1RM  ‚úÖ SAME
  - 90s rest                    ‚úÖ SAME
  - Note: "Focus on explosiveness" ‚úÖ SAME
  - exercise_id: [new_id]      ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ONLY THIS CHANGES
  - is_placeholder: false       ‚¨ÖÔ∏è AND THIS
```

### What Exercise.com Does (Our Model)

From the conversation summary, you mentioned:
> "the way that exercise.com does their switch is that **no matter what exercise is switched into the one before it inherits the sets and reps and metrics that were already there**"

This is the correct behavior we need to implement.

## Simplified Swap Logic

### Database Update (Simple!)

```typescript
async function handleSwapExercise(
  exerciseId: string,      // routine_exercise.id (the row we're updating)
  newExerciseId: string,   // new exercise.id (the exercise we're swapping to)
  newExercise: Exercise    // new exercise object (for enabled_measurements)
) {
  // Get the new exercise's available measurements
  const newMeasurements = newExercise.metric_schema?.measurements || [];
  const newMeasurementIds = newMeasurements.map(m => m.id);

  // Update ONLY the exercise reference and enabled_measurements
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('routine_exercises')
    .update({
      exercise_id: newExerciseId,         // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Point to new exercise
      is_placeholder: false,               // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è No longer a placeholder
      placeholder_id: null,                // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Clear placeholder data
      placeholder_name: null,              // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Clear placeholder data
      enabled_measurements: newMeasurementIds  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Update available measurements

      // ‚úÖ KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE:
      // - sets (stays same)
      // - metric_targets (stays same - values like 8 reps, 75%, etc.)
      // - intensity_targets (stays same)
      // - set_configurations (stays same)
      // - rest_seconds (stays same)
      // - notes (stays same)
      // - is_amrap (stays same)
      // - tempo (stays same)
    })
    .eq('id', exerciseId);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error swapping exercise:', error);
    alert('Failed to replace exercise');
    return;
  }

  // Refresh the UI
  await fetchWorkout();
}
```

### That's It!

No compatibility checking needed. No filtering measurements. Just swap the exercise reference and let the UI handle displaying the measurements based on `enabled_measurements`.

---

## Why This Works

### The Architecture Already Supports This

1. **`metric_targets`** stores generic key-value pairs:
   ```json
   {
     "reps": 8,
     "weight": 225,
     "distance": 100
   }
   ```
   These values don't care what exercise they're attached to!

2. **`enabled_measurements`** tells the UI which inputs to show:
   ```json
   ["reps", "weight"]
   ```
   When we swap exercises, we update this to match the new exercise's schema.

3. **The UI renders inputs dynamically** based on `enabled_measurements`:
   - If new exercise has "reps", show reps input with value from `metric_targets.reps`
   - If new exercise has "distance", show distance input with value from `metric_targets.distance`
   - If new exercise doesn't have "weight", that input just doesn't appear (but value stays in database)

### Example: Box Jump ‚Üí Broad Jump

```
BEFORE (Box Jump):
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "height"]
  metric_targets: { reps: 10, height: 24 }

  UI shows:
    Reps: [10]
    Height: [24]

AFTER SWAP (Broad Jump):
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "distance"]  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Updated
  metric_targets: { reps: 10, height: 24 }    ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Unchanged!

  UI shows:
    Reps: [10]           ‚úÖ Still there!
    Distance: [ ]         ‚¨ÖÔ∏è New field (blank)

  Height value (24) still in database, just not displayed
```

### User Can Fix Incompatible Measurements

If they swap to an exercise with different measurements, they just:
1. See the compatible values still filled in (reps, sets, rest, etc.)
2. See blank inputs for new measurement types
3. Fill in the blanks manually

**No warnings needed!** The user can see what needs to be filled.

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Swap Dialog (20 mins)

**File**: `components/dashboard/workouts/swap-exercise-dialog.tsx`

Just a simple exercise picker - no compatibility checking!

```typescript
interface SwapExerciseDialogProps {
  onSwap: (exerciseId: string, exercise: Exercise) => void;
  onClose: () => void;
}

export function SwapExerciseDialog({ onSwap, onClose }: SwapExerciseDialogProps) {
  const [exercises, setExercises] = useState<Exercise[]>([]);
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

  // Fetch exercises (same as add-exercise-dialog)
  // Search/filter exercises
  // Click exercise ‚Üí calls onSwap(exercise.id, exercise)

  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
      {/* Search bar */}
      {/* Exercise list */}
      {/* Select button */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Add Button Handler (5 mins)

**File**: `components/dashboard/workouts/exercise-detail-panel.tsx`

```typescript
interface ExerciseDetailPanelProps {
  routine: Routine | null;
  exercise: RoutineExercise | null;
  onUpdate: (updates: Partial<RoutineExercise>) => void;
  onDelete: () => void;
  onSwap: (newExerciseId: string, newExercise: Exercise) => void; // NEW
}

export default function ExerciseDetailPanel({
  routine,
  exercise,
  onUpdate,
  onDelete,
  onSwap
}: ExerciseDetailPanelProps) {
  const [showSwapDialog, setShowSwapDialog] = useState(false);

  // Update button (around line 220)
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowSwapDialog(true)}  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ADD THIS
    className="p-2 hover:bg-white/10 rounded text-gray-400 hover:text-white transition-colors"
    title="Replace Exercise"
  >
    <span className="text-lg">‚Üª</span>
  </button>

  // Add dialog at end
  {showSwapDialog && (
    <SwapExerciseDialog
      onSwap={(newExerciseId, newExercise) => {
        onSwap(newExerciseId, newExercise);
        setShowSwapDialog(false);
      }}
      onClose={() => setShowSwapDialog(false)}
    />
  )}
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Swap in Workout Builder (10 mins)

**File**: `app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx`

```typescript
async function handleSwapExercise(
  newExerciseId: string,
  newExercise: Exercise
) {
  if (!selectedExerciseId) return;

  // Get new exercise's measurements
  const newMeasurements = newExercise.metric_schema?.measurements || [];
  const newMeasurementIds = newMeasurements.map(m => m.id);

  // Simple update - just change exercise reference
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('routine_exercises')
    .update({
      exercise_id: newExerciseId,
      is_placeholder: false,
      placeholder_id: null,
      placeholder_name: null,
      enabled_measurements: newMeasurementIds
    })
    .eq('id', selectedExerciseId);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error swapping exercise:', error);
    alert('Failed to replace exercise');
    return;
  }

  await fetchWorkout();
}

// Pass to ExerciseDetailPanel
<ExerciseDetailPanel
  routine={selectedRoutine}
  exercise={selectedExercise}
  onUpdate={handleUpdateExercise}
  onDelete={handleDeleteExercise}
  onSwap={handleSwapExercise}  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ADD THIS
/>
```

### Step 4: Copy to Routine Builder (5 mins)

**File**: `app/dashboard/routines/[id]/page.tsx`

Same function, same pattern.

### Step 5: Copy to Plan Workout Builder (5 mins)

**File**: `components/dashboard/plans/workout-builder-modal.tsx`

Same function, same pattern.

## Total Time: ~45 minutes

Much simpler than the original plan!

## What Happens in Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Placeholder ‚Üí Real Exercise
```
BEFORE:
  [TBD Exercise] - 3x8 @ 75%
  metric_targets: { reps: 8 }
  enabled_measurements: ["reps"]

AFTER (swap to Power Clean):
  Power Clean - 3x8 @ 75%
  metric_targets: { reps: 8 }         ‚¨ÖÔ∏è SAME
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "weight"]  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Updated

UI NOW SHOWS:
  Reps: [8]      ‚úÖ Preserved
  Weight: [ ]     ‚¨ÖÔ∏è User fills this in
```

### Scenario 2: Exercise ‚Üí Different Exercise (Compatible)
```
BEFORE (Back Squat):
  3x8 @ 185 lbs
  metric_targets: { reps: 8, weight: 185 }
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "weight"]

AFTER (Front Squat):
  3x8 @ 185 lbs  ‚úÖ ALL SAME!
  metric_targets: { reps: 8, weight: 185 }
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "weight"]
```

### Scenario 3: Exercise ‚Üí Different Exercise (Incompatible)
```
BEFORE (Box Jump):
  3x10, 24" height
  metric_targets: { reps: 10, height: 24 }
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "height"]

AFTER (Broad Jump):
  metric_targets: { reps: 10, height: 24 }  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è SAME (height value still in DB)
  enabled_measurements: ["reps", "distance"]  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Updated

UI NOW SHOWS:
  Reps: [10]      ‚úÖ Preserved
  Distance: [ ]    ‚¨ÖÔ∏è User fills this in
  (Height input hidden, but value still in DB in case they swap back)
```

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files (1)
‚ú® `components/dashboard/workouts/swap-exercise-dialog.tsx`

### Modified Files (4)
üìù `components/dashboard/workouts/exercise-detail-panel.tsx` - Add button handler
üìù `app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx` - Add swap function
üìù `app/dashboard/routines/[id]/page.tsx` - Add swap function
üìù `components/dashboard/plans/workout-builder-modal.tsx` - Add swap function

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Swap placeholder ‚Üí real exercise (values preserved)
- [ ] Swap exercise ‚Üí different exercise (same measurements)
- [ ] Swap exercise ‚Üí different measurements (reps stay, new metrics blank)
- [ ] Swap exercise with intensity targets (targets preserved)
- [ ] Swap exercise with AMRAP (AMRAP flag preserved)
- [ ] Swap exercise with set-by-set config (config preserved)
- [ ] Swap exercise with notes (notes preserved)
- [ ] Cancel swap (no changes)
- [ ] Works in workout builder
- [ ] Works in routine builder
- [ ] Works in plan workout builder

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Swap changes only `exercise_id`, `is_placeholder`, and `enabled_measurements`
‚úÖ All programming details (sets, reps, intensity, rest, notes) stay the same
‚úÖ UI updates immediately to show new exercise
‚úÖ Compatible measurements display with existing values
‚úÖ Incompatible measurements show blank (user fills in)
‚úÖ No data loss - old measurement values stay in database
‚úÖ Works across all three builders

---

## Summary

**The Fix**: We were overcomplicating it! Just update the exercise reference and let the existing UI logic handle displaying the right inputs. All values stay the same - exactly like Exercise.com does it.

**Why It Works**: Our architecture with `metric_targets` (generic values) + `enabled_measurements` (what to show) already supports this perfectly.

**Implementation**: Much simpler - just 5 small updates across existing files.
