## üéØ DATA FLOW

### Creating a Workout
1. User clicks "+ Create Workout" in library
2. System creates workout with default name "New Workout"
3. Redirects to workout builder
4. User edits name, duration, notes
5. User adds routines
6. User adds exercises to routines
7. User configures targets for each exercise
8. Changes auto-save to database

### Creating a Template Workout
1. User creates normal workout
2. User clicks "+ Add Exercise" in a routine
3. User switches to "Placeholder" mode
4. User enters placeholder name (e.g., "Main Throwing Exercise")
5. System:
   - Creates placeholder definition in workout.placeholder_definitions
   - Sets workout.is_template = true
   - Creates routine_exercise with is_placeholder = true
6. Placeholder shows with blue badge in builder

### Assigning a Workout
1. User clicks "Assign to Athlete" in builder
2. Dialog opens
3. User selects athlete or team
4. User selects date
5. System creates workout_instance(s)
6. If template:
   - placeholder_resolutions = {} (empty, to be filled later)
   - Alert: "Athlete will need to select exercises"
7. If not template:
   - Alert: "Workout assigned successfully!"

### Template Resolution (Future Phase)
1. Athlete opens calendar
2. Sees workout instance with placeholders
3. For each placeholder:
   - Selects actual exercise from library
   - System stores in workout_instances.placeholder_resolutions
   - Example: `{"ph_123456": "exercise_uuid_abc"}`
4. Workout now shows resolved exercises

## üî• INTENSITY SYSTEM

### Intensity Types

**% 1RM (Percent of One Rep Max)**
- Used for: Strength exercises (squats, bench press, etc.)
- Coach sets: 85% 1RM
- System calculates: If athlete's 1RM = 300 lbs ‚Üí Target = 255 lbs
- Stored: `intensity_type = 'percent_1rm'`, `intensity_percent = 85`

**Absolute Load**
- Used for: Fixed weight prescriptions
- Coach sets: 225 lbs
- Athlete uses: Exactly 225 lbs
- Stored: `intensity_type = 'absolute'`, `target_load = 225`

**% Max Velocity**
- Used for: Throwing programs (long toss, etc.)
- Coach sets: 70% max velocity
- System calculates: If athlete's max = 90 mph ‚Üí Target = 63 mph
- Stored: `intensity_type = 'percent_max_velo'`, `intensity_percent = 70`

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)**
- Used for: Auto-regulated training
- Coach sets: RPE 8 (out of 10)
- Athlete adjusts weight to feel RPE 8
- Stored: `intensity_type = 'rpe'`, `target_rpe = 8`

**None**
- Used for: Bodyweight exercises, mobility, warm-ups
- No load tracking
- Stored: `intensity_type = null`
