# Cell 4.4B: Placeholder System + Create Workout in Plan - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Build Type:** Critical Missing Piece - Completing Cell 4.4

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS BUILT

This build addresses the **critical gap** identified in Cell 4.4: the ability to create workouts directly inside the plan builder, not just copy from templates.

### The Problem
After completing Cell 4.4, the user identified:
> "theres no workout builder inside the plan builder (if you select a day) isnt this a massive piece to the plan"

Previously, you could only:
- ‚úÖ Copy existing template workouts to a plan
- ‚ùå Create NEW workouts directly in the plan

This was a **40% missing piece** of the complete plan builder experience.

### The Solution
Cell 4.4B implements:
1. **Placeholder Name Column** - Store placeholder names directly on routine_exercises
2. **Enhanced Placeholder Dialog** - Add sets/reps/intensity when creating placeholders
3. **Create Workout in Plan Modal** - Build workouts directly in plan context
4. **Dual-Button UI** - "Create New" vs "Copy from Library" options

---

## üìÅ FILES CREATED

### 1. Database Migration Script
**File:** [docs/ADD_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_COLUMN.sql](docs/ADD_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_COLUMN.sql)

**What it does:**
```sql
-- Add placeholder_name column to routine_exercises
ALTER TABLE routine_exercises
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS placeholder_name TEXT;

-- Constraint: If placeholder, must have placeholder_name
ALTER TABLE routine_exercises
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_placeholder_name
  CHECK (
    (is_placeholder = false) OR
    (is_placeholder = true AND placeholder_name IS NOT NULL)
  );

-- Index for finding placeholders by name
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_routine_exercises_placeholder_name
  ON routine_exercises(placeholder_name)
  WHERE is_placeholder = true;
```

**Why it's needed:**
- Denormalizes placeholder names for performance (no JOIN required)
- Ensures data integrity (placeholders MUST have names)
- Enables fast placeholder lookups

**Status:** ‚úÖ Script ready - USER MUST RUN in Supabase SQL Editor

---

### 2. Create Workout in Plan Modal
**File:** [components/dashboard/plans/create-workout-in-plan-modal.tsx](components/dashboard/plans/create-workout-in-plan-modal.tsx)

**What it does:**
- Modal dialog for creating NEW workouts directly in plan
- Collects: workout name, category, duration, notes
- Sets `plan_id` on the created workout (marks as Plan-Owned)
- Automatically assigns workout to specific week/day in program_days table
- Opens workout builder in NEW TAB for immediate editing

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Creates workout with plan_id set (Plan-Owned context)
const { data: newWorkout } = await supabase
  .from('workouts')
  .insert({
    name: workoutName.trim(),
    category,
    estimated_duration_minutes: parseInt(estimatedDuration) || null,
    notes: notes.trim() || null,
    is_template: false,
    plan_id: planId,  // üîë Critical: Marks as Plan-Owned
    athlete_id: null,
    source_workout_id: null,
    placeholder_definitions: { placeholders: [] }
  });

// Assign to program day
await supabase
  .from('program_days')
  .update({ workout_id: newWorkout.id })
  .eq('plan_id', planId)
  .eq('week_number', weekNumber)
  .eq('day_number', dayNumber);

// Open in new tab
window.open(`/dashboard/workouts/${newWorkout.id}`, '_blank');
```

**UI Design:**
- Dark theme matching existing aesthetics
- Week/Day context shown in header (e.g., "Week 2, Tuesday")
- Blue info box explaining next steps
- "Create & Open Workout" button opens builder in new tab

---

## üìù FILES MODIFIED

### 1. Add Exercise Dialog - Placeholder Enhancements
**File:** [components/dashboard/workouts/add-exercise-dialog.tsx](components/dashboard/workouts/add-exercise-dialog.tsx)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `placeholderSets` state (default: '3')
- ‚úÖ Added `placeholderReps` state (default: '10')
- ‚úÖ Added `placeholderIntensity` state (default: '')
- ‚úÖ Updated `onAdd` interface to accept sets/reps/intensity parameters
- ‚úÖ Added UI fields for sets, reps, intensity in placeholder mode
- ‚úÖ Updated `handleAddPlaceholder()` to pass all parameters

**Visual Changes:**
```typescript
// New fields in placeholder mode:
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <input placeholder="3" value={placeholderSets} />    // Sets
  <input placeholder="10" value={placeholderReps} />   // Reps
  <input placeholder="RPE 7" value={placeholderIntensity} /> // Intensity
</div>
```

**Why this matters:**
- Coaches can set default sets/reps/intensity when creating placeholders
- These values flow down when workout is copied to athletes
- Athletes see placeholder with pre-configured targets

---

### 2. Workout Builder - Handle Placeholder Parameters
**File:** [app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx](app/dashboard/workouts/[id]/page.tsx)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `handleAddExercise()` signature to accept sets/reps/intensity
- ‚úÖ Added logic to save sets ‚Üí `sets` column
- ‚úÖ Added logic to save reps ‚Üí `reps_min` and `reps_max` columns
- ‚úÖ Added logic to save intensity ‚Üí `notes` column

**Code:**
```typescript
async function handleAddExercise(
  exerciseId: string,
  isPlaceholder: boolean,
  placeholderId?: string,
  placeholderName?: string,
  categoryHint?: string,
  sets?: string,        // NEW
  reps?: string,        // NEW
  intensity?: string    // NEW
) {
  const exerciseData: any = {
    routine_id: newRoutine.id,
    exercise_id: isPlaceholder ? null : exerciseId,
    is_placeholder: isPlaceholder,
    placeholder_id: placeholderId || null,
    placeholder_name: isPlaceholder ? placeholderName : null,
    order_index: 0
  };

  // Add sets/reps/intensity if provided
  if (sets) exerciseData.sets = parseInt(sets) || null;
  if (reps) {
    const repsNum = parseInt(reps);
    exerciseData.reps_min = repsNum || null;
    exerciseData.reps_max = repsNum || null;
  }
  if (intensity) exerciseData.notes = intensity;

  await supabase.from('routine_exercises').insert(exerciseData);
}
```

---

### 3. Plan Calendar - Dual-Button UI
**File:** [app/dashboard/plans/[id]/page.tsx](app/dashboard/plans/[id]/page.tsx)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added import for `CreateWorkoutInPlanModal`
- ‚úÖ Added state: `showCreateWorkout: { week: number; day: number } | null`
- ‚úÖ Replaced single "+" button with TWO buttons:
  - **"+ Create New"** (blue, prominent) ‚Üí Opens CreateWorkoutInPlanModal
  - **"Copy from Library"** (gray, secondary) ‚Üí Opens AddWorkoutToPlanDialog
- ‚úÖ Added `<CreateWorkoutInPlanModal>` component at bottom

**Visual Changes:**

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
<button onClick={() => setShowWorkoutLibrary(true)}>
  +
</button>
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
<div className="space-y-1">
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowCreateWorkout({ week: weekNumber, day: dayNumber })}
    className="... border-blue-500/30 text-blue-400 ..."
  >
    + Create New
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowWorkoutLibrary(true)}
    className="... border-neutral-800 text-neutral-600 ..."
  >
    Copy from Library
  </button>
</div>
```

**Design Decision:**
- "Create New" is visually primary (blue accents)
- "Copy from Library" is secondary (gray, less prominent)
- Users are encouraged to create fresh workouts in plan context

---

## üîÑ COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### Creating a Workout Directly in Plan

1. **User opens plan calendar** ‚Üí `/dashboard/plans/[id]`
2. **User clicks "+ Create New"** on any day
3. **CreateWorkoutInPlanModal opens:**
   - Shows "Week X, Day Y" context
   - User enters: name, category, duration, notes
   - User clicks "Create & Open Workout"
4. **Backend creates workout:**
   - Sets `plan_id` (marks as Plan-Owned)
   - Assigns to program_days for that week/day
5. **Workout builder opens in NEW TAB** ‚Üí `/dashboard/workouts/[id]`
6. **User builds workout:**
   - Add exercises
   - Add placeholders with sets/reps/intensity
   - Configure routines and blocks
7. **User closes tab, returns to plan calendar**
8. **Workout appears in the day cell**

### Adding Placeholders with Targets

1. **In workout builder, click "Add Exercise"**
2. **Switch to "Placeholder" mode**
3. **Fill in:**
   - Placeholder Name (e.g., "Main Hitting Exercise")
   - Category Hint (e.g., "Hitting")
   - Sets (e.g., "3")
   - Reps (e.g., "10")
   - Intensity (e.g., "RPE 7")
4. **Click "Add Placeholder"**
5. **Placeholder saved with:**
   - `placeholder_name` = "Main Hitting Exercise"
   - `sets` = 3
   - `reps_min` = 10, `reps_max` = 10
   - `notes` = "RPE 7"

### Placeholder Display

- Sidebar shows placeholder name (not "Placeholder Exercise")
- Blue "PH" badge identifies it as a placeholder
- Sets/reps/intensity display in detail panel
- When copied to athlete, these values flow down

---

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE CHANGES

### New Column: `routine_exercises.placeholder_name`

**Type:** TEXT
**Nullable:** Yes
**Constraint:** If `is_placeholder = true`, `placeholder_name` must NOT be NULL

**Purpose:**
- Denormalized placeholder name for fast display
- Avoids JOIN to workout.placeholder_definitions
- Improves sidebar rendering performance

### New Index: `idx_routine_exercises_placeholder_name`

**Type:** Partial index (WHERE is_placeholder = true)
**Purpose:** Fast lookup of placeholder exercises by name

---

## üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Before Cell 4.4B
- Single "+" button ‚Üí only "Copy from Library"
- No way to create workout directly in plan
- Placeholders had no default sets/reps/intensity
- Placeholder dialog was minimal

### After Cell 4.4B
- **Dual buttons:**
  - "Create New" (primary, blue)
  - "Copy from Library" (secondary, gray)
- **Create workflow:**
  - Modal shows week/day context
  - Opens workout builder in new tab
  - Automatic assignment to program_days
- **Enhanced placeholder creation:**
  - Set default sets/reps/intensity
  - Coach intent captured upfront
  - Values flow down to athletes

---

## ‚úÖ TESTING CHECKLIST

Run these tests to verify Cell 4.4B implementation:

### Database Migration
- [ ] Run `ADD_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_COLUMN.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify column exists: `SELECT placeholder_name FROM routine_exercises LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Verify constraint exists: Check `pg_constraint` table
- [ ] Verify index exists: Check `pg_indexes` table

### Create Workout in Plan
- [ ] Open any training plan
- [ ] Click "+ Create New" on any day
- [ ] Enter workout name, category, duration
- [ ] Click "Create & Open Workout"
- [ ] Verify workout opens in NEW TAB
- [ ] Verify workout appears in plan calendar day cell
- [ ] Check database: workout has `plan_id` set
- [ ] Check database: program_days has `workout_id` set

### Placeholder with Sets/Reps/Intensity
- [ ] In workout builder, click "Add Exercise"
- [ ] Switch to "Placeholder" mode
- [ ] Enter: name, category, sets, reps, intensity
- [ ] Click "Add Placeholder"
- [ ] Verify placeholder appears in sidebar with "PH" badge
- [ ] Verify placeholder name displays (not generic "Placeholder")
- [ ] Click placeholder ‚Üí detail panel shows sets/reps/notes
- [ ] Check database: `placeholder_name` column populated
- [ ] Check database: `sets`, `reps_min`, `reps_max`, `notes` populated

### Context Badges
- [ ] Open workout created in plan
- [ ] Verify header shows "Plan-Owned" badge (blue)
- [ ] Open template workout
- [ ] Verify header shows "Template Library" badge (purple)

### Integration Test
- [ ] Create workout in plan with placeholders
- [ ] Copy workout from template library to plan
- [ ] Verify both appear in calendar
- [ ] Verify both have plan_id set
- [ ] Delete plan
- [ ] Verify workouts are deleted (CASCADE)

---

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **RUN THE DATABASE MIGRATION FIRST**
   - Cell 4.4B depends on `placeholder_name` column
   - Without it, placeholder creation will fail
   - Run `ADD_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_COLUMN.sql` before testing

2. **Test Ownership Contexts**
   - Workouts created in plan MUST have `plan_id` set
   - Template workouts MUST have `plan_id = NULL`
   - Athlete workouts MUST have `athlete_id != NULL`

3. **Test Cascade Deletes**
   - Deleting plan should delete all plan-owned workouts
   - Deleting workout should delete all routines
   - Deleting routine should delete all routine_exercises

4. **Test Placeholder Display**
   - Placeholders MUST show custom name (not generic text)
   - "PH" badge MUST appear
   - Sets/reps/intensity MUST save and display

- **Dual-button UI (Create vs Copy)**
- **Placeholder_name column in database**

Together, Cell 4.4 + 4.4B = **Complete Plan Builder Experience**

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS FOR USER

### Step 1: Verify Database Schema

**Check if ownership context columns exist:**

The following columns should exist on the `workouts` table:
- `plan_id` (UUID, nullable, references training_plans)
- `athlete_id` (UUID, nullable, references athletes)
- `source_workout_id` (UUID, nullable, references workouts)
- `placeholder_definitions` (JSONB)

If these columns don't exist, you need to run the ADD_OWNERSHIP_CONTEXTS migration from Cell 4.4.

**Then run the placeholder_name migration:**
```bash
# Open Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy/paste contents of: docs/ADD_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_COLUMN.sql
# Execute the script
# Verify with the verification queries at bottom
```

### Step 2: Test Create Workout Flow
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/plans`
2. Open any plan
3. Click "+ Create New" on any day
4. Fill in workout details
5. Click "Create & Open Workout"
6. Verify workout opens in new tab
7. Add exercises and placeholders
8. Return to plan calendar
9. Verify workout appears in day cell

### Step 3: Test Placeholder with Targets
1. In workout builder, add placeholder
2. Set sets, reps, intensity
3. Verify values save to database
4. Verify values display in sidebar/detail panel

### Step 4: Complete Testing Checklist
Work through the full testing checklist above to ensure all features work correctly.
