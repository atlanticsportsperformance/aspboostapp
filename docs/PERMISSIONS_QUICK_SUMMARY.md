# Permissions System - Quick Summary

## 🎯 What You Have Now

✅ **Database**: 45 permission columns - all set up and working
✅ **UI Editor**: Full permissions editor in Staff page - works perfectly
✅ **Permission Functions**: All helper functions ready to use in `lib/auth/permissions.ts`
✅ **Super Admin**: You (Max DiTondo) have ALL permissions enabled

## ❌ What's NOT Done Yet

The permissions **exist** but they don't **control** anything yet.

**Example**: Even if you uncheck "Can Create Exercises" for a coach, they can still click "Add Exercise" and create one. The button shows for everyone, and the API doesn't check permissions.

---

## 📝 What Needs to Be Done

### For EVERY feature (Exercises, Workouts, Routines, Plans, Athletes, Groups):

1. **Hide the "Add/Create" button** if user doesn't have permission
2. **Hide edit/delete buttons** if user doesn't have permission
3. **Filter the list** so users only see content they're allowed to see
4. **Protect the API routes** so even if someone bypasses the UI, the backend blocks them

---

## 🚀 Simple Implementation Pattern

For each feature, you do this:

```typescript
// 1. Get user's permissions
const { permissions, userRole } = useStaffPermissions(userId);

// 2. Hide "Create" button
{permissions.can_create_exercises && (
  <button>Add Exercise</button>
)}

// 3. Hide "Edit" button on each item
{canEditContent(userId, userRole, 'exercises', exercise.created_by) && (
  <button>Edit</button>
)}

// 4. Hide "Delete" button on each item
{canDeleteContent(userId, userRole, 'exercises', exercise.created_by) && (
  <button>Delete</button>
)}

// 5. Filter the list
const filter = await getContentFilter(userId, userRole, 'exercises');
// Use filter.creatorIds to only show allowed exercises

// 6. In API route, check permissions
if (!canCreateContent(userId, userRole, 'exercises')) {
  return 403 Forbidden
}
```

## 📋 Features to Update (in order of priority)

### High Priority:
1. ✅ **Exercises** - Most used, needs protection first
2. ✅ **Workouts** - Most used, needs protection first
3. ✅ **Athletes** - Critical data, must protect
4. ✅ **Staff** - Prevent unauthorized access

### Medium Priority:
5. ✅ **Routines**
6. ✅ **Plans**
7. ✅ **Groups**
8. ✅ **Navigation** (hide nav items users can't access)

### Low Priority:
9. ✅ **VALD Force Plates** (just one button)
10. ✅ **Dashboard Stats** (nice to have - show filtered counts)

## 🔑 Key Files

- **Full Roadmap**: `docs/PERMISSIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (detailed step-by-step)
- **Permission Functions**: `lib/auth/permissions.ts` (all the helper functions you need)
- **Permission Editor**: `components/dashboard/staff/staff-permissions-tab.tsx` (already done!)

---

## 💡 When You're Ready to Implement

1. Open the full roadmap: `PERMISSIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
2. Pick a feature (start with Exercises)
3. Follow the checklist for that feature
4. Test with different roles
5. Move to next feature

**That's it!** The hard part (database, UI, functions) is done. Now it's just connecting the dots.

---

## ⚠️ Remember

- **Super Admin bypasses everything** - always returns `true` for all checks
- **Check permissions in BOTH UI and API** - UI hides buttons, API blocks actions
- **Test with different roles** - Make a test coach account to verify

**The full roadmap has code examples for everything!**
