## Summary
All Phase 1 tasks have been completed successfully. The "Created By" feature is now fully functional across all content types.

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Plans Missing "Created By" Column
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **File**: [app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx](app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `created_by` and `creator` to TrainingPlan interface
  - Updated query to join with profiles table on line 42-49
  - Added "Created By" column to grid layout
  - Shows creator avatar with initials + full name

### Issue 2: Create Functions Not Setting created_by
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Files Modified**: 4 files

1. **Exercises** - [components/dashboard/exercises/create-exercise-dialog.tsx:199-204](components/dashboard/exercises/create-exercise-dialog.tsx#L199-L204)
   ```typescript
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   const result = await supabase.from('exercises').insert({
     ...exerciseData,
     created_by: user?.id || null
   });
   ```

2. **Workouts** - [app/dashboard/workouts/page.tsx:100](app/dashboard/workouts/page.tsx#L100)
   ```typescript
   created_by: user?.id || null,   // ✅ Set creator
   ```

3. **Routines** - [app/dashboard/routines/page.tsx:101](app/dashboard/routines/page.tsx#L101)
   ```typescript
   created_by: user?.id || null,  // Set creator
   ```

4. **Plans** - [app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx:90](app/dashboard/plans/page.tsx#L90)
   ```typescript
   created_by: user.id,  // Set creator
   ```

## Database State

### Tables Modified (Phase 1)
1. ✅ `exercises` - Added `created_by UUID` column
2. ✅ `workouts` - Added `created_by UUID` column
3. ✅ `routines` - Already had `created_by` column
4. ✅ `training_plans` - Already had `created_by` column

### New Tables Created (Phase 1)
1. ✅ `coach_athletes` - Junction table for coach-athlete assignments
   - Fields: coach_id, athlete_id, assigned_by, is_primary, notes
   - Indexes: coach_id, athlete_id, (athlete_id, is_primary)

2. ✅ `staff_permissions` - Granular permission settings per staff member
   - 3 content visibility fields (exercises, workouts, routines)
   - 1 athlete visibility field
   - 14 feature permission flags (create/edit/delete for each content type)
   - 18 total permission fields

### Default Permissions Seeded
- ✅ All existing staff (4 members) have permission records
- ✅ Default visibility: 'all' (maintains current behavior)
- ✅ Safe defaults: can create/edit own content, cannot delete/edit admin content

### Database Verification

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check exercises created_by column
SELECT id, name, created_by FROM exercises ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check workouts created_by column
SELECT id, name, created_by FROM workouts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check routines created_by column
SELECT id, name, created_by FROM routines ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check plans created_by column
SELECT id, name, created_by FROM training_plans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Verify staff permissions seeded
SELECT
  p.email,
  p.app_role,
  sp.exercises_visibility,
  sp.can_create_exercises,
  sp.can_edit_own_exercises
FROM staff_permissions sp
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = sp.staff_id
ORDER BY p.app_role, p.email;
```

## Migration Files

All SQL migration files are in [scripts/](scripts/) directory:

1. [phase1-add-created-by-columns.sql](scripts/phase1-add-created-by-columns.sql)
2. [phase1-create-coach-athletes-table.sql](scripts/phase1-create-coach-athletes-table.sql)
3. [phase1-create-staff-permissions-table.sql](scripts/phase1-create-staff-permissions-table.sql)
4. [phase1-seed-default-permissions.sql](scripts/phase1-seed-default-permissions.sql)

All migrations have been run successfully via Supabase.

## Next Steps

Once testing is complete, proceed to **Phase 2: Core Authorization System**

Phase 2 will implement:
- `lib/auth/permissions.ts` - Granular permission checking functions
- `useStaffPermissions()` - React hook to fetch staff permissions
- `useCoachAthletes()` - React hook to get coach's assigned athletes
- Integration with existing role system

See [PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM_PLAN.md](PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM_PLAN.md) for full implementation plan.
