# Exercise Library - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Built a complete Exercise Library system with customizable measurements, category-based organization, and flexible tagging. Exercises support multiple tags for detailed filtering while maintaining broad category grouping.

---

## Database Schema

### `exercises` table structure:
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key)
- name: text (exercise name)
- category: text (required, one of: 'strength_conditioning', 'hitting', 'throwing')
- tags: text[] (optional array, flexible labels like 'power', 'mobility', 'velocity')
- description: text (optional)
- video_url: text (optional)
- cues: text[] (optional array)
- equipment: text[] (optional array)
- metric_schema: JSONB (stores measurement configuration)
  {
    "measurements": [
      { "id": "reps", "name": "Reps", "type": "integer", "unit": "reps", "enabled": true },
      { "id": "weight", "name": "Weight", "type": "decimal", "unit": "lbs", "enabled": true }
    ]
  }
- is_active: boolean (soft delete flag)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

### Categories (3 fixed options):
- **Strength + Conditioning** (`strength_conditioning`)
- **Hitting** (`hitting`)
- **Throwing** (`throwing`)

### Locked Measurements (cannot be edited/deleted):
- `reps`, `weight`, `time`, `sets`, `distance`, `exit_velo`, `peak_velo`

---

## File Structure

### Created Files:
- **`components/dashboard/exercises/custom-measurements-manager.tsx`** (900+ lines)
  - Central hub for managing measurements and tags
  - Two tabs: Custom Measurements & Tags
  - CRUD operations for both measurements and tags
  - Shows usage counts
  - Edit/delete affects ALL exercises using that item

- **`migrate-category-to-tags.sql`** (historical - already run)
  - Migrated from single category to tags array

- **`add-categories-back.sql`** (run this next)
  - Adds category column back alongside tags
  - Migrates existing data based on tags

- **`seed-measurements.sql`** (historical - already run, can delete)
  - Seeded 4 core measurements

### Modified Files:
- **`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`**
  - Added Exercises navigation link (üí™)

- **`components/dashboard/exercises/create-exercise-dialog.tsx`**
  - Category dropdown (required)
  - Tags dropdown selector (optional, multiple)
  - Dynamic tag fetching from database
  - Dynamic measurement fetching from database
  - All measurements removed from hardcoded constants

- **`app/dashboard/exercises/page.tsx`**
  - Category filter dropdown
  - Tag filter dropdown (multi-select)
  - Active tag filter pills with remove buttons
  - Table shows: Name, Category, Tags, Measurements, Created date
  - Real-time filtering (category + tags + search)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Exercise Management
- **Create/Edit Exercise**:
  - Name (required)
  - Category (required, dropdown: Strength + Conditioning, Hitting, Throwing)
  - Tags (optional, select multiple from dropdown or add custom)
  - Measurements (select from available, managed in Library Manager)
  - Description, Video URL, Cues, Equipment

### 2. Library Manager (‚öôÔ∏è button)
**Custom Measurements Tab**:
- View all measurements with usage counts
- Locked measurements shown (cannot edit/delete): reps, weight, time, sets, distance, exit_velo, peak_velo
- Edit unlocked measurements (updates ALL exercises)
- Delete unlocked measurements (removes from ALL exercises)
- Create custom measurements (name, type, unit)
- Types: Integer, Decimal, Text

**Tags Tab**:
- View all tags with usage counts
- Edit tags (renames across ALL exercises)
- Delete tags (removes from ALL exercises)
- Create custom tags

### 3. Exercise Library Page
**Filtering**:
- Search bar (name or tags)
- Category filter (dropdown)
- Tag filter (multi-select dropdown)
- Active filters shown as removable pills

**Display**:
- Table with columns: Thumbnail, Name, Category, Tags, Measurements, Created
- Category badge (gold)
- Tag badges (colored by tag name)
- Measurement badges (gray)

### 4. Database-First Architecture
- Single source of truth: Supabase database
- Both Library Manager and Exercise Creator fetch dynamically
- No hardcoded measurements or tags
- Changes in Library Manager reflect everywhere (after dialog reopen)

## User Workflows

### Creating an Exercise
1. Click "+ Create Exercise"
2. Enter name
3. Select category (Strength + Conditioning, Hitting, or Throwing)
4. Select tags from dropdown (optional, multiple allowed)
5. Add custom tag if needed (text input)
6. Select measurements from checkboxes
7. Add description, video URL, cues, equipment
8. Save

### Filtering Exercises
1. Use category dropdown to filter by broad category
2. Use tag dropdown to add tag filters (AND logic - must have ALL)
3. Active tag filters shown as pills, click √ó to remove
4. Search bar filters by name or tags
5. All filters work together in real-time

### Managing Measurements
1. Click "‚öôÔ∏è Manage Library"
2. Go to "Custom Measurements" tab
3. View all measurements (locked shown with no edit/delete buttons)
4. Edit unlocked measurement ‚Üí updates ALL exercises
5. Delete unlocked measurement ‚Üí removes from ALL exercises
6. Create new measurement ‚Üí available in Exercise Creator after reopen

### Managing Tags
1. Click "‚öôÔ∏è Manage Library"
2. Go to "Tags" tab
3. View all tags with usage counts
4. Edit tag ‚Üí renames across ALL exercises
5. Delete tag ‚Üí removes from ALL exercises
6. Create new tag ‚Üí available in Exercise Creator after reopen

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
Database (Supabase)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Library Manager (fetch & manage)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Exercise Creator (fetch & use)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Exercise List Page (fetch, display, filter)
```

### Filtering Logic (Exercise List)
```typescript
1. Filter by category (if not "all")
2. Filter by tags (AND logic - must have ALL selected tags)
3. Filter by search query (name OR tags contain query)
4. Display filtered results
```

### Tag System Benefits
- **Categories**: Broad grouping (3 options) for high-level filtering
- **Tags**: Flexible labels (unlimited) for detailed organization
- Exercises can have one category + multiple tags
- Example: Back Squat ‚Üí Category: "Strength + Conditioning", Tags: ["power", "lower_body"]

---

## SQL Migration Required

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Add category column back alongside tags
ALTER TABLE exercises ADD COLUMN category text DEFAULT 'strength_conditioning';

-- Update category based on existing tags (best guess migration)
UPDATE exercises
SET category = 'hitting'
WHERE 'hitting' = ANY(tags);

UPDATE exercises
SET category = 'throwing'
WHERE 'throwing' = ANY(tags) OR 'pitching' = ANY(tags);

-- Make category required (not null)
ALTER TABLE exercises ALTER COLUMN category SET NOT NULL;

-- Verify migration
SELECT id, name, category, tags FROM exercises WHERE is_active = true LIMIT 10;
```

## Next Phase Recommendations

With Exercise Library complete, consider:
1. **Plans/Programs** - Create workout plans using exercises
2. **Athlete Profiles** - Assign exercises/plans to athletes
3. **Progress Tracking** - Record measurement values over time
4. **Calendar Integration** - Schedule exercises/plans
5. **Data Visualization** - Charts/graphs for measurements

## Dev Server
- Running on: `http://localhost:3001`
- Status: ‚úÖ No compilation errors

---

**Exercise Library is production-ready!** The dual system (categories + tags) provides both structured organization and flexible filtering for optimal UX.
