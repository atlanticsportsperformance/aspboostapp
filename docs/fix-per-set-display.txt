Fix applied to exercise-detail-panel.tsx:

When hamburger menu (☰) is collapsed and set_configurations exists,
show a read-only summary of the per-set data instead of the simple mode inputs.

This ensures the values shown are always consistent whether the per-set editor is expanded or collapsed.

Summary view will show:
- Set 1: 3 reps, 135 lbs @ 75%
- Set 2: 5 reps, 135 lbs @ 75%
- Set 3: 5 reps AMRAP, 135 lbs @ 75%

With a blue info box saying "Per-Set Configuration Active - Click ☰ to edit details"
