# Exercises Permissions - Implementation Complete âœ…

**Date**: 2025-01-29
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Frontend + RLS Ready

---

## Summary

The Exercises feature now has **FULL permissions enforcement** at both the UI level and database level.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Permissions (âœ… Complete)

**File Modified**: `app/dashboard/exercises/page.tsx`

#### Features Added:

1. **User Authentication & Role Detection**
   - Fetches current user ID and role on page load
   - Uses `useStaffPermissions()` hook to get permissions

2. **Visibility Filtering**
   - Filters exercises query based on `exercises_visibility` setting:
     - **"all"** â†’ Shows all exercises from everyone
     - **"own"** â†’ Shows only exercises created by current user
     - **"own_and_admin"** â†’ Shows user's exercises + admin-created exercises
   - Filtering happens at query level for performance

3. **Create Button Permission**
   - "+ Create" button only visible if:
     - User is super_admin, OR
     - `can_create_exercises` permission is true

4. **Edit Button Permission (per exercise)**
   - Edit button only visible if:
     - User created the exercise AND `can_edit_own_exercises` is true, OR
     - Exercise was created by admin AND `can_edit_admin_exercises` is true
   - Cannot edit other coaches' exercises

5. **Delete Button Permission (per exercise)**
   - Delete button only visible if:
     - User created the exercise AND `can_delete_own_exercises` is true, OR
     - Exercise was created by admin AND `can_delete_admin_exercises` is true
   - Cannot delete other coaches' exercises

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Permissions for all exercises are computed once after loading
   - Cached in `exercisePermissions` state object
   - No repeated permission checks on render

---

### 2. Database Permissions (ðŸ“„ RLS Script Ready)

**File Created**: `database/rls-policies-exercises.sql`

#### Policies Created:

1. **SELECT Policy** (`exercises_select_policy`)
   - Enforces visibility at database level
   - Mirrors the "exercises_visibility" permission logic
   - Prevents unauthorized data from even reaching the client

2. **INSERT Policy** (`exercises_insert_policy`)
   - Only allows INSERT if `can_create_exercises` is true
   - Super admins bypass this check

3. **UPDATE Policy** (`exercises_update_policy`)
   - Only allows UPDATE based on ownership and permissions
   - Checks `can_edit_own_exercises` and `can_edit_admin_exercises`

4. **DELETE Policy** (`exercises_delete_policy`)
   - Only allows DELETE based on ownership and permissions
   - Checks `can_delete_own_exercises` and `can_delete_admin_exercises`

## Permission Matrix

| Permission | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| `exercises_visibility: "all"` | User sees ALL exercises in the list |
| `exercises_visibility: "own"` | User sees ONLY their own exercises |
| `exercises_visibility: "own_and_admin"` | User sees their own + admin exercises |
| `can_create_exercises: true` | "+ Create" button is visible |
| `can_create_exercises: false` | "+ Create" button is hidden |
| `can_edit_own_exercises: true` | Edit button shows on user's own exercises |
| `can_edit_admin_exercises: true` | Edit button shows on admin exercises |
| `can_delete_own_exercises: true` | Delete button shows on user's own exercises |
| `can_delete_admin_exercises: true` | Delete button shows on admin exercises |

## How to Deploy RLS Policies

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **SQL Editor**
2. Open `database/rls-policies-exercises.sql`
3. Copy the entire script
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**
6. Verify in **Database** â†’ **Policies** that 4 policies now exist for `exercises` table

## Testing Checklist

### Test as Super Admin:
- [ ] Can see ALL exercises (regardless of creator)
- [ ] Can see "+ Create" button
- [ ] Can see Edit button on ALL exercises
- [ ] Can see Delete button on ALL exercises

### Test as Admin with Full Permissions:
- [ ] Visibility "all": Can see all exercises
- [ ] Visibility "own_and_admin": Can see own + other admins' exercises
- [ ] Visibility "own": Can see only own exercises
- [ ] Can create exercises (if permission enabled)
- [ ] Can edit own exercises (if permission enabled)
- [ ] Can edit admin exercises (if permission enabled)
- [ ] Can delete own exercises (if permission enabled)
- [ ] Can delete admin exercises (if permission enabled)

### Test as Coach with Restricted Permissions:
- [ ] Visibility "own": Only sees own exercises
- [ ] Cannot see "+ Create" button (if permission disabled)
- [ ] Cannot see Edit button on other coaches' exercises
- [ ] Cannot see Delete button on admin exercises
- [ ] Can only edit/delete own exercises (if permissions enabled)

### Test as Coach with NO Permissions:
- [ ] List is empty (visibility: "own" with no created exercises)
- [ ] No "+ Create" button
- [ ] No Edit buttons
- [ ] No Delete buttons

## Architecture Notes

### Why No API Routes?

Exercises use **direct Supabase queries** from the client, not API routes. This is common in Supabase applications because:

1. **Supabase handles authentication** via JWT tokens
2. **RLS policies provide backend protection** at the database level
3. **No need for middleware** - the database IS the middleware

This is actually **MORE secure** than API routes because:
- Policies are enforced even if someone bypasses the UI
- Policies are tested and maintained in one place (database)
- No way to circumvent permissions by calling a different endpoint

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Filtering**: Visibility filtering happens at the database level using `WHERE created_by IN (...)`, which is indexed and fast

2. **Permission Caching**: After loading exercises, we compute all permissions ONCE and cache them in state. This prevents repeated async calls on every render.

3. **Indexed Columns**: The `idx_exercises_created_by` index ensures fast filtering by creator

---

## Next Steps

Now that Exercises are complete, we can apply the same pattern to:

1. **Workouts** (same permissions structure)
2. **Routines** (same permissions structure)
3. **Plans** (same permissions structure)
4. **Athletes** (different visibility model: "assigned" vs "all")
5. **Groups** (different visibility model: "own", "assigned", "all")
6. **Staff** (different permissions: `can_view_staff`, `can_manage_staff`)

Each feature will get:
- Frontend UI permissions (like we just did)
- RLS policies script
- Testing checklist

## Files Modified

- âœ… `app/dashboard/exercises/page.tsx` - Added full permissions logic
- âœ… `database/rls-policies-exercises.sql` - Created RLS policies script
- âœ… `docs/EXERCISES_PERMISSIONS_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for permission errors
2. Verify user has a `staff_permissions` record in the database
3. Verify RLS policies are enabled: `ALTER TABLE exercises ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
4. Check policy logic in Supabase Dashboard â†’ Policies
5. Test with different users to isolate permission issues

**Status**: âœ… Ready for Testing & Deployment
