## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

None currently - all features working as expected!

## üí° DESIGN PATTERNS USED

**Exercise.com Inspiration:**
- "Import as Scheduled" = Use plan's week_number/day_of_week
- "Choose Days" = Map workouts sequentially to selected days only
- First workout selector = Start from any workout in plan

**Drag & Drop:**
- Library items use `data: { workout }`
- Existing chips use `data: { workoutInstance }`
- handleDragEnd checks which data exists

**View Modes:**
- Grid = Traditional calendar with 7x5 grid
- Month Details = Linear list showing full workout info

---

## üìù TECHNICAL NOTES

**Workouts Table Schema:**
```sql
- id (uuid)
- plan_id (uuid, nullable) -- NULL = standalone workout
- name (text)
- week_number (int, nullable)
- day_of_week (text, nullable)
- estimated_duration_minutes (int)
- created_at, updated_at
```

**No `category` column!** - This caused initial bugs

**Import Modes Logic:**
- **As Scheduled:** Calculate date = startDate + (week-1)*7 + dayOfWeek
- **Choose Days:** Assign workouts sequentially to selected days only
