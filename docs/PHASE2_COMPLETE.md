- **Granular permissions** (18 permission fields per staff member)
- **Staff CRUD operations** (Add, Edit, Delete staff members)
- **Permission management UI** (Visual editor with toggles)
- **Coach-Athlete assignments** (Many-to-many relationships)

## Files Created

### 1. Core Permission System

**[lib/auth/permissions.ts](lib/auth/permissions.ts)** - Core permission logic

- `getCoachAthleteIds()` - Get athletes assigned to a coach
- `canViewContent()` - Check if user can view content
- `canViewAthlete()` - Check if user can view athlete
- `canCreateContent()` - Check if user can create content
- `canEditContent()` - Check if user can edit content
- `canDeleteContent()` - Check if user can delete content
- `getContentFilter()` - Get query filters based on permissions
- `getAthleteFilter()` - Get athlete filters based on permissions

**Types:**
- `ContentVisibility`: 'own' | 'own_and_admin' | 'all'

  routines_visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'own_and_admin',
  athletes_visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'assigned',
  -- Exercise permissions (5 fields)
  can_create_exercises BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_own_exercises BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_admin_exercises BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_own_exercises BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_admin_exercises BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  -- Workout permissions (5 fields)
  can_create_workouts BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_own_workouts BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_admin_workouts BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_own_workouts BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_admin_workouts BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  -- Routine permissions (5 fields)
  can_create_routines BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_own_routines BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  can_edit_admin_routines BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_own_routines BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete_admin_routines BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
```

### `coach_athletes` Table

CREATE TABLE coach_athletes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  coach_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  athlete_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES athletes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assigned_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(coach_id, athlete_id)
);
```

## Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Current Limitations

1. **Admin User Creation**: The `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` function requires admin privileges. You may need to:
   - Create an API route that uses the service role key
   - Or use Supabase Dashboard to manually create users for now

2. **Permission Enforcement**: Permissions are stored in the database but NOT yet enforced in:
   - Content list queries (exercises, workouts, routines)
   - Athlete list queries
   - Create/Edit/Delete operations

3. **Role Changes**: Changing a staff member's role updates the profile, but may need additional logic to:
   - Update default permissions
   - Notify the user
   - Handle role-specific data

### Phase 3: Permission Enforcement (Next)

- Update exercises/workouts/routines queries to filter by permissions
- Add permission checks before create/edit/delete operations
- Show/hide UI elements based on permissions
- Add athlete filtering for coaches
- Create "Permission Denied" error states

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Bulk assign athletes to coaches
- Permission templates/presets
- Permission history/audit log
- Email notifications for assignments
- Coach dashboard showing "My Athletes"
